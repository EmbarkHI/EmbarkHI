## Inspiration
>Travelling is fun only when it _isn’t routine_. Most travel applications do not leave room for flexibility, and come across as mundane surveys rather than meaningful user experiences. We sought to create something that brings a layer of uncertainty and excitement into travel planning without compromising on the quality!

## What it does
>Embark doesn’t need to know much about your travel plans to find optimal destinations. While some basic preferences are essential to navigate across the vast Amadeus API, we made an effort to minimize the user’s input to search for destinations within the user’s budget and preferences. Embark creates a travel plan, in terms of a destination, flight and hotel costs and dates. 

## How we built it
>We used Flask, a python web framework, to power the backend, and used HTML, CSS and Javascript for the frontend. To gather our data, and eventually use it, we used various APIs in Amadeus’s Travel Innovation Sandbox, like the Points of Interest APIs, Nearest Relevant Airport, Airport Autocomplete, Flight Low-Fare Search and Airport Hotel Search. The image sprite on the landing page was created using Blender. 

## Challenges we ran into
>We didn’t have a lot of experience with Flask, which is why the first hurdle we faced was creating a stable link between the python in the backend and the HTML and Javascript in the frontend. 

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
>We’re proud of how the application combines the use of many different API results into one destination, with a single budget. We believe that this takes away a lot of work for the user, and makes it easier to compare destinations. We’re also proud of how we successfully deployed Flask without a lot of prior experience using it. 

## What we learned
>Through this experience, we learned a lot about making user experiences that continuously engage the user. We learnt about the importance of having a good understanding and clarity in thought when different components of the application are built by different team members.

## What's next for Embark
>The major transition we’d look to make would be from a simple indexing system to one where transactions can be made. Even if that isn’t possible, we’d like to perhaps output travel plan data that can be used by other applications that support transactions. This would add a greater depth to the indexing, as users could use the data prepared by Embark to simply pay for the travel plan without a lot of effort.
